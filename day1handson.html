   <h3 class="head2">What is Css?</h3>
   <p >1.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
   <p>2.CSS describes how <b>HTML</b> elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</p>
   <p>3.<span >Css is not necessary</span> <mark class="special">Css saves a lot of work.</mark> can control the lyout of multiple web pages all at once</p>
  <p class="">4.External Stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
   <h3 class="head2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements </li>
       <li>Internal-by using a style element in head section</li>
       <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external css file</li>
       <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<mark class="special"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</mark></li>
   </ul>
   <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID ,the difference is that CSS class apllies a style to multiple elemnts ,ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique ekemnt .ID is also
       special in that you can use a special <b>URL</b> to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.
   </p>
   <p>In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
   <p>There is a wide range of selectors avaialble.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
